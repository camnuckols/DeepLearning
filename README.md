# Neural Networks & Deep Learning Notes
This is a collection of my notes as I learn more about neural networks & deep learning. The majority of the notes come from what I learned from Andrew Ng's [Neural Network and Deep Training Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning).

* [Week 1 - Neural Networks](/notes/week1-neuralNetworks.md)
* [Week 2 - Logistic Regression & Python](/notes/week2-logisticRegression&Python.md)
* [Week 3 - Shallow Neural Networks](/notes/week3-shallowNeuralNetworks.md)
