#Week 1 - Neural Networks

ReLU function = Rectified Learning Unit function
* ____ then an angle up (that’s what it looks like)
* These functions are the simplest neural network

Neural network = takes in an x, gives you a y. It automatically calculates the hidden values for you that are in between.

Neural networks are most commonly found in supervised learning.

Recurring Neural Network (RNN-think time) = audio single with a time (sequenced data)

* Speech Recognition
* English to Chinese
Custom/hybrid = Autonomous vehicles

Structured Data = data in a database or table
Unstructured data = data that doesn’t have a form. Text, photos, video, or audio.
