# Week 1 - Neural Networks

**Neural network** - A computer-based system meant to model a human brain. Neural networks are used to make computers "think."
* Neural networks take in an x, and spit back out a y. They automatically calculate the hidden values for you that are in between.
* They are most commonly found in supervised learning.

**ReLU function** - The simplest neural network that exists.
* It stands for rectified learning unit function.
* The picture below shows what a ReLU function looks like.

**Recurring Neural Network (RNN)** - These neural networks are used to understand sequenced data.
* An example of an RNN would be an audio clip.
* RNN's are generally remembered as neural networks that deal with time.
* Used for speech recognition and to translate languages. i.e. from English to Chinese

**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** - These neural networks are generally used to tag photos.

**Custom/hybrid networks** - These networks can be a combination or a mixture of different networks. An example of a custom neural network would be autonomous vehicles.

### Types of Data
* **Structured Data** - Data that can be found in a database or table.
* **Unstructured data** - Data without form. Text, photos, video, and audio are all good examples of unstructured data.
